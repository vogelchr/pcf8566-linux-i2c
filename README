A short demo to talk to a pcf8566 LCD controller via i2c.

The particular board I have is from the junk-drawer at work
and of unknown provenance. It features a single pcf8566
strapped to sub-address 0 and i2c address 0x3e and features
a 6-digit 7-segment LCD. On the left-hand side the LCD can
also show the symbols "A", "D" and an additional minus sign.

The i2c bus being used is /dev/i2c-0, using the Linux i2c dev API.
